# Download
###########
- Java FX is not part of JDK11
- so need to download from site: https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/
- once downloaded - set it up in default project structure:
Global Libraries -> add java-fx folder lib files

- HelloWorld project is created by default in IntelliJ with module info files + dependencies

# Overview
###########
- JavaFX was designed with the MVC pattern in mind
- this pattern keeps the code that handles an application's data separate from the UI Code
- thus, we wouldn't mix the code that deals with the UI and the code that manipulates the application data in the same class
- controller is the middleman between the UI and the data

- Main class should extend Applicaton => entry point
init() -> start(Stage )

Stage is like Windows and Scene is like UI nodes
